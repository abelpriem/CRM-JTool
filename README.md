## Description

This CRM system allows businesses to manage their customers, products, and orders efficiently through an interactive admin panel. Users can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on orders, with secure authentication and role-based access.

The main goal is to enhance customer relationship management while streamlining internal workflows and data handling.
